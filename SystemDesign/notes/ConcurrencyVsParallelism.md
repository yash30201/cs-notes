# Concurrency

Abillity of the system to handle multiple tasks concurrently, **seemingly simultaneously**. In concurrent systems, tasks may start, run, pause (allowing other tasks to run) and resume.

# Parallelism

Parallelism involves simultaneously executing multiple tasks / processes in multiple cores / processors => **truly simultaneous**
